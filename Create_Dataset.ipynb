            "['By Nelson Renteria,SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador has mined nearly 474 bitcoins since 2021 thanks to a volcano-fueled geothermal power plant, official data showed on Tuesday, bringing the government\\'s total bitcoin portfolio to nearly $354 million at current prices.,The country\\'s \"Bitcoin Office,\" an official government entity, reports that government coffers now hold 5,750 bitcoins.,The new additions, 473.5 bitcoins worth some $29 million since September of 2021, were powered by a small amount of geothermal energy generated by the country\\'s imposing Tecapa volcano, touted as a green way to accumulate the well-known cryptocurrency, which is not regulated by any central bank.,The administration of Bitcoin enthusiast President Nayib Bukele, who earlier this year was reelected to a second term, has installed 300 processors to \"mine\" bitcoins from the volcano.,Of the 102 megawatts (MW) produced by the state-owned power plant, 1.5 MW are devoted to cryptocurrency mining. The so-called crypto mining process requires large amounts of energy for computing and cooling data processing centers, which perform complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.,Elsewhere in the world, cryptocurrency miners have recently come under increased scrutiny for their electricity-sapping operations, and for the impact their activity has on power grids and carbon emissions.,In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar which it adopted two decades earlier. The bitcoin move earned Nayib\\'s government harsh criticism for its embrace of the volatile cryptocurrency, including from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).,Cryptocurrency miners Foundry USA, Ant pool, ViaBTC, F2Pool and Binance Pool pooled their resources to win a reward for opening a blockchain that can verify the last three years of bitcoin transactions originating from the power plant, according to the government Bitcoin Office.,(Reporting by Nelson Renteria; Editing by David Alire Garcia and Aurora Ellis)', 'Cryptocurrency-related hiring activity remained strong in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024 and registered quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) growth as companies such as Coinbase and Binance posted significant number of jobs. Yet, April saw a slowdown, indicating challenges amid market volatility and regulatory uncertainties, reveals the Job Analytics Database of GlobalData, publishers of EPI.,Sherla Sriprada, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, said: “The hiring activity could have been driven by bearish sentiment prevailing during Q1 2024. Most of the firms were seen betting big on the Web3 job market anticipating an increased adoption of blockchain technology in decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).,“However, the cryptocurrency market has remained vulnerable to significant volatility and hiring trends can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. For instance, President Biden’s stance against crypto can also act as a big blow. In fact, we have already seen April 2024 not able to sustain the hiring momentum set in Q1 and we need to keep an eye on how things unfold.”,Coinbase’s “Executive Director, Coinbase Institute” role will lead the edge of policy development in the cryptocurrency space and will play an important role in advancing the company’s policy strategy in the US. The role will keep a pulse on substantive policy developments in the crypto ecosystem, while also keeping a close watch on operational matters such as the Policy team’s budget and long-term strategic planning.,The “Senior Business Development Manager (APAC Payment)” role in Binance looks at managing and dealing with APAC/Africa regulatory parties, government bodies, and bankers ranging from outreaching, pitching, and negotiations to relationship management. Moreover, the role also emphasises creating and executing localised fiat strategies to aid in the adoption of the crypto-based ecosystem and co-develop existing payment products and markets.,The “Business Development Director, Ecosystem” role in Circle Internet Financial will establish and grow strategic partnerships with major global organisations such as crypto exchanges to drive the adoption and growth of the USD Coin (USDC). The role also looks at the professional and technical knowledge of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.,OKEX “Product Director/Principal Product Manager, On-chain Compliance” role looks at crafting anti-money laundering (AML) compliance software and investigative services for the key participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, advancing compliance platform, and contributing to setting industry standards for cryptocurrency intelligence.,Sriprada added: “The demand for crypto has seen cycles of rise and fall over the last few years, and it is advisable to stay updated with industry news, job platforms specialised in the crypto industry to get the most accurate and up-to-date information on crypto job opportunities.”,\"Crypto hiring thrives in Q1 2024, but April slump highlights volatility and regulatory concerns, says GlobalData\" was originally created and published by Electronic Payments International, a GlobalData owned brand.,,\\xa0,The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

All rights reserved.', 'The crypto lobby is more powerful than ever this year, and has already shaped some key Congressional elections,The crypto industry is hoping that a friendlier and more educated group of lawmakers could finally push through a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies,Though crypto-holding voters tend to prefer Trump for president, industry insiders are split on whether or not a Trump presidency would actually be better for crypto,The crypto industry is throwing its weight around in Washington in hopes of influencing the upcoming U.S. elections, spending an unprecedented amount of money to get crypto-friendly candidates elected and educate lawmakers – all in hopes of finally getting a friendly regulatory framework for crypto established.,Crypto-focused political action committees (PACs) like Fairshake – which has raised around $85 million from a collection of crypto companies, executives and retail investors – have successfully shaped the outcome of some relevant races, including spending $10 million helping squash the bid of crypto-critical Congresswoman Katie Porter (D-Calif.).,Fairshake has also poured money into two affiliated PACs: Defend American Jobs, which donates to Republican candidates, and Protect Progress, which donates to Democrats. Both have donated to winning campaigns. Over the last two months, Defend American Jobs spent nearly $500,000 on media buys for Republican Mark Messmer, an Indiana state senator, who won the Republican nomination for Indiana’s 8th district congressional seat this week.,Some of Protect Progress’ crypto-friendly Democratic candidates, including Shomari Figures, who is running for a House seat in Alabama and Julie Johnson in Texas, have also won their primaries with media buy help.,\"It’s at a level that we just haven’t seen in past election cycles,\" said Kristin Smith, CEO of crypto lobbying group the Blockchain Association.,Industry insiders say the economic power of the industry has even spurred some crypto skeptics – including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who is up for re-election this year – to take a more open-minded stance towards crypto, lest they face well-funded opposition efforts from the industry.,\"Previously he was no friend of crypto but recently [Brown] said he was open to considering cryptocurrency legislation,\" said Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the tech-focused Chamber of Progress. \"I think he’s cognizant of the money from outside industry groups that are looking for politicians that are open to reasonable, common-sense cryptocurrency policies and aren\\'t just trying to prop up or support the traditional financial ecosystem without allowing for innovation.\",Though the industry’s past efforts to shape national-level election outcomes have been largely unsuccessful – and, in the case of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, criminal – the crypto industry’s growing political influence now seems to have more staying power.,\"It’s a much more sophisticated operation,\" Smith said. \"I feel like I used to walk around Washington, and people would say ‘Oh, there’s Kristin, she works for that little blockchain industry thing.’ Now it’s like, ‘Oh wow, that’s the powerful crypto industry and they’re here to influence Washington and are pulling out all the tools to do it.\",Though the crypto industry has largely focused its lobbying efforts on Congressional elections, the U.S. presidential election will also have a significant impact on crypto regulation.,According to at least one small poll commissioned by crypto investment firm Paradigm,, crypto-holding voters tend to prefer Donald Trump for president – although, according to other polls, the percentage of voters who own crypto is small. Polymarket bettors currently give Trump the slight edge to win (47% to Biden’s 44%). But industry insiders are less certain on whether a Trump presidency would actually be better for crypto.,During his presidency Trump was outspoken about his distaste for crypto but has since softened his stance, even saying earlier this week that he was open to accepting crypto campaign donations. In an interviews with CNBC earlier this year, Trump admitted to dabbling in the markets himself (he has sold several tranches of non-fungible tokens) and said that he is \"not sure [he would] want to take it away at this point,\" though implied that he could move to curb crypto’s influence if it ever undermined the dominance of the U.S. dollar.,Though Trump’s crypto stance is shifting, it’s still markedly less crypto-friendly than that of his former competitor for the Republican presidential nomination, Vivek Ramaswamy, who pledged to protect crypto developers and create a clear regulatory structure for crypto that would see most tokens as commodities.,Even though Ramawamy is no longer in the running – and will reportedly not be considered as Trump’s running mate – industry insiders suggest his crypto policies could still have an influence on Trump if he’s elected.,\"Trump looks to Vivek on tech and digital asset policy,\" claimed Lee Bratcher, founder and president of the Texas Blockchain Council. \"He didn’t always do that, but when he saw how Vivek captured the Republican voter – and more centrist [voters] than Trump can capture – he’s probably more interested in that [policy].\",Industry insiders were split on whether a Biden re-election would be bad for the crypto industry.,Smith said it would likely be \"more of the same, unless [Securities and Exchange Commission Chair] Gary Gensler decides to step aside,\" meaning continued regulatory uncertainty and aggressive enforcement actions. A better, more open-minded SEC chair, she added, would be \"hugely helpful.\",\"It’s unfortunate because, at the beginning of the Biden Administration there was some interest in crypto – and then the industry imploded while they were doing all of their reports and as a result they’re in a clearly negative spot right now,\" Smith said. \"On [Biden’s] watch, the industry had some not-so-great moments and it’s understandable that regulators are concerned.\",Smith said that, while the crypto industry has largely moved on from the 2022 crypto collapse – including the implosions of FTX, Terra/LUNA and Three Arrows Capital – regulators have much longer memories.,\"Having a fresh batch of regulators come in would be helpful in re-starting conversations,\" Smith said.,Others, like Bligen, seemed more hopeful for crypto-friendly legislation to pass post-election if Biden stays in power.,\"I can’t say that if President Biden is reelected that that’s a loss for cryptocurrency advocates, because currently in this regime Democrats and Republicans are working together on a bipartisan basis to produce productive and responsible cryptocurrency [legislation],\" said Bligen.,There are ongoing efforts in the current Congress to pass crypto legislation, including a bipartisan effort to regulate stablecoins.,Those efforts at legislation – which, in the past, have failed to find footing – still have significant hurdles to clear before being passed, including getting more members of Congress on board with crypto.,Bligen said that there are still many members of Congress who don’t know much about crypto, and the things they do know about it \"come from flashy headlines about cryptocurrency scams, people misrepresenting coins, people being defrauded out of their money, massive crypto institutions failing – they view it from a protectionist angle,\" he said.,\"If you want to have more people that are friendly to crypto, every single office needs to be provided with a base understanding of what is cryptocurrency, why does it matter to my constituents and what is the policy landscape that regulates it. Everybody needs to know that,\" Bligen said. \"If you don’t have that basic information, you’re going to have members fumbling around, trying to grasp what blockchain technology is…there needs to be more concerted education efforts. We’re not just going to get to a more educated 2025, work has to be put in.\",Bratcher added that, in addition to education efforts, the industry may have to compromise on certain issues – like privacy – in order to make real progress with lawmakers.,\"We stand at an interesting crossroads when it comes to privacy,\" Bratcher said, referencing the ongoing crackdown on bitcoin mixing services like Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet.,\"People in the digital assets industry want to prioritize privacy above everything else. When we work with government – state, local and national, and even with law enforcement – we don’t have the luxury of being able to make grandiose claims around that, Bratcher added. \"There will have to be a balance between privacy and issues pertaining to money laundering and national security.\",Bratcher said that bad behavior by privacy services like Samourai – which actively promoted its mixing services to \"dark/grey market participants\" – makes working with elected officials much harder.,\"Tornado Cash is not a hill I’m willing to die on,\" Bratcher said. \"We could lose a war if we choose to die on the hill of Tornado Cash.\",Though the spotlight is on national elections, Bratcher and others – like Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin mining advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund – are focusing their efforts on state politics.,Porter’s group has helped introduce bills in 16 U.S. states that provide protections for bitcoin mining and self-custody. The furthest along of the bills is in Oklahoma, where it has been passed in both the state House and Senate, and is awaiting a signature by Governor Kevin Stitt (R).,\"D.C. is fun and sexy. Tons of money is spent there, but so far we haven’t seen any big wins – all of the important battles are happening at the state level,\" Porter said.,Porter said the industry should continue to build its presence in D.C. but said that it will not find the magical cure to all of its ills on Capitol Hill.,\"The way that we’re going to do that is at the state level,\" Porter said. \"We’re going to go state-by-state advocating for pro-digital assets policy using the states as a laboratory for democracy, eventually taking those good ideas and using them to influence policy at the federal level. Or at the bare minimum, creating a regulatory regime that protects people at the state level.\",Porter’s model for crypto regulation takes a page out of the cannabis industry’s playbook – building up momentum and support in the states until the industry is powerful enough to shape federal regulations.,\"We’re swinging for home runs over and over and over again in D.C. but we’re not strong enough yet,\" Porter said. \"I just think we’re further away from that than we realize…The big story for me is that we need to be spending much more time at the state level, investing much more money, because the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent in D.C., if spent at the state level, would radically reshape the policy landscape and would radically change the dynamic for bitcoin and digital assets in America.\"', 'A Chinese-owned Bitcoin miner is being kicked of its land in Wyoming following an order from President Joe Biden. The administration has given the miner and its partners 120 days to sell the land they operate on due to spying concerns, the White House said in a statement. MineOne Partners runs the mine, which is less than a mile away from Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, which stores intercontinental nuclear missiles.,“The presence of specialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities presents a national security risk,” the White House said. Neither MineOne Partners nor China\\'s U.S. embassy immediately responded to requests for comment.,MineOne bought the land in 2022 and later installed cryptocurrency mining equipment, according to the statement. At the time, the transaction was not filed with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, but it was later alerted to them by a member of the public. CFIUS then deemed the purchase to have national security implications after an investigation. Last October, The New York Times reported that the tipoff had came from Microsoft, which operates a nearby data center supporting the Pentagon, cautioning that it could enable the Chinese to “pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations.”,The decision \"highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.,Land purchases in the U.S. from Chinese companies are “absolutely going up,” Anita Nikolich, head researcher of technology innovation at the University of Illinois, told Fortune. As a result, 33 states introduced 81 bills last year attempting to curtail foreign purchases of land, according to reporting by the Washington Post. Nikolich says the order against the Wyoming operation isn\\'t specifically an attack on Bitcoin miners but rather part of a bigger picture: There are “many recent indicators of adversarial activity” in critical infrastructure, and foreign purchases of land near such infrastructure, that the Biden administration \"can\\'t ignore.\",Indeed, in February it was revealed that a Chinese hacking network known as Volt Typhoon had been dormant inside U.S. plane, train, and water infrastructure for five years, “pre-positioning” itself for future sabotage, intelligence services said in a statement. Volt Typhoon is “the defining threat of our generation,” FBI director Christopher Wray told a U.S. committee hearing soon after.,MineOne is just one of many Chinese-owned miners building data centers in Southern states and in the Midwest, where agricultural land is abundant and energy is cheap. Of that rise, \"we\\'re seeing a huge slew of Bitcoin miners,” says Nikolich. The Times found Chinese-owned or operated miners in at least 12 states, which together use as much energy as 1.5 million homes. The flurry of purchases are a result of the Chinese Communist Party banning Bitcoin mining in 2021, upending the country’s former status as an industry leader and forcing operations overseas.,At least one of those mines, Polaris Technologies, in Muskogee, Oklahoma, may have circumvented state laws on foreign-owned land purchases. The miner last May purchased an industrial site from the State of Oklahoma, land deeds obtained by Fortune show. The company is using the land to build a $100 million data center. Polaris CEO Meng Zhang is a Chinese citizen and former employee of Bitmain, a Chinese company that produces 90% of Bitcoin mining machines and ASICs (a type of advanced semiconductor).,Some miners have been incentivized to build data centers with deals granting companies access to the grid at a discount. For instance, one Chinese-owned miner, Bison Blockchain, won cheaper-than-usual rates from the state of Wyoming and its energy subsidiary, Black Hills energy. Several companies came in to bid on the deal, which essentially said, “We will buy energy from you for a number of years, and you in turn will build a substation specifically for our data center,” Nikolich explained.,The statement also coincides with today\\'s announcement from Biden that he is raising tariffs on various Chinese imports, which he argues are unfairly subsidized by Beijing and undermine U.S. competitors. The imports affected include semiconductors, which could pose a hike in production costs for U.S. miners that rely on mining ASICs, 98% of which are produced by Chinese firms.,This story was originally featured on Fortune.com', 'Liquity\\'s upgraded protocol aims to take on the increasing competition for DeFi yields, with plans to go live in the third quarter.,The new stablecoin, BOLD, will coexist with Liquity\\'s LUSD, adding liquid staking ETH derivatives as collateral assets to provide liquidity or leverage for investors.,Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Liquity (LQTY)\\'s planned upgrade will include an overcollateralized stablecoin that makes use of liquid-staking tokens of ether {{ETH}} as backing assets and allows user-set interest rates for loans, a first in DeFi, according to the protocol.,\"Current protocols either rely on slow and potentially misaligned human governance to adjust interest rates, or they don’t have a targeted way of using interest payments to drive demand for their stablecoin,\" according to a white paper published Tuesday. \"Liquity V2 will change that.\",Details of the new version, which is scheduled for late in the third quarter, arrive as new yield-earning strategies and DeFi-native stablecoins have helped lift investment returns from the depths of a crypto winter in 2022 and 2023.

It\\'s now about $700 million, DefiLlama data shows.,The new stablecoin, called BOLD, will co-exist with LUSD. It will allows borrowers to take out loans by depositing ETH and liquid staking ETH derivatives as collateral while setting their preferred interest rate and plans to pay most of the revenue from borrowing fees into the stability pool and secondary markets incentivized by the protocol.,The idea behind letting borrowers set the loan rates is to align incentives: The more borrowers are willing to pay, the more revenue they contribute to the protocol to pay out for BOLD holders in stability and liquidity pools.,\"LUSD is great for its decentralized capabilities, but it doesn\\'t have the built-in flexibility to adapt to changing market environments like rising or falling interest rates,\" Samrat Lekhak, head of business development and communications at Liquity, said in an interview over Telegram. \"In times of positive interest rates, this implies a need for a continuous yield source for the stablecoin, which BOLD provides.\",Liquity plans to go live with the protocol in late third quarter of this year, Lekhak said.', \"Per a regulatory filing, Wells Fargo & Company WFC has announced exposures to cryptocurrencies through investments in numerous Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

However, they share a variety of similarities. Both have experienced significant price increases over the past several years, largely driven by retail investors aiming to challenge the larger financial system. However which asset has been more successful at this goal, measured through price appreciation? Let\\'s take a closer look.,Don\\'t Miss:,If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.,1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?,DOGE and GME both experienced significant gains in 2020 and 2021 as billions of dollars flowed into the projects, causing the prices to soar.,The price of GME went from less than $20 at the start of 2021 to nearly $500 on Jan. 28, 2021. This marked a price increase of over 2,700% in less than a month.,For DOGE, the price surged from less than $0.05 in February 2021 to an all-time high (ATH) of nearly $0.75 in April 2021, representing gains of 1,400%.,At the time, these price movements sparked huge amounts of media attention. Regarding DOGE, the price movements were largely attributed to tweets from Elon Musk, along with a viral component on social media. For GME, the price increases were the result of mass buying from the Reddit community, r/WallStreetBets. Additionally, some brokerages began to limit buying activity on the stock, which angered investors and further fueled the rally.,However, the significant price increases occurred several years ago, and some of the hype has since subsided. While both assets are still well above where they were in 2020, they are down significantly from the highs that were seen in the first half of 2021. Despite this, there has been continued interest in the assets following the decline from their peaks, and both have surprisingly performed well over the past two years.,If you invested $1,000 in each of DOGE and GME two years ago, you would be sitting on a total of $2,860. Of this, the investment in DOGE would be worth $1,660, and the investment in GME would be worth $1,200.,The price of DOGE has gone from $0.09 two years ago to a price of $0.15 today. Over the time frame, the price of GME has increased from $25 in May 2022 to $30 in May 2024.,However, it is important to note that the price of GME surged in May 2024, following a return to social media by Roaring Kitty, the financial analyst who played a key role in bringing attention to GME in 2020 and 2021. The price of GME went from less than $11 in early May to over $30 at the time of writing. So, the investment in GME would not have been profitable until the middle of May.,Together, the investments would have yielded a return of over 40%, beating out the S&P500\\'s gains of just over 30% in the same period.,According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here’s why it can be true.,Bitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year – how much would you need to get started today?,\"ACTIVE INVESTORS\\' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!,Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?,GAMESTOP (GME): Free Stock Analysis Report,This article Dogecoin (DOGE) Vs.

            " Cryptocurrency-related hiring activity remained strong in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024 and registered quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) growth as companies such as Coinbase and Binance posted significant number of jobs. Yet, April saw a slowdown, indicating challenges amid market volatility and regulatory uncertainties, reveals the Job Analytics Database of GlobalData, publishers of EPI.,Sherla Sriprada, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, said: “The hiring activity could have been driven by bearish sentiment prevailing during Q1 2024. Most of the firms were seen betting big on the Web3 job market anticipating an increased adoption of blockchain technology in decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).,“However, the cryptocurrency market has remained vulnerable to significant volatility and hiring trends can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. For instance, President Biden’s stance against crypto can also act as a big blow. In fact, we have already seen April 2024 not able to sustain the hiring momentum set in Q1 and we need to keep an eye on how things unfold.”,Coinbase’s “Executive Director, Coinbase Institute” role will lead the edge of policy development in the cryptocurrency space and will play an important role in advancing the company’s policy strategy in the US. The role will keep a pulse on substantive policy developments in the crypto ecosystem, while also keeping a close watch on operational matters such as the Policy team’s budget and long-term strategic planning.,The “Senior Business Development Manager (APAC Payment)” role in Binance looks at managing and dealing with APAC/Africa regulatory parties, government bodies, and bankers ranging from outreaching, pitching, and negotiations to relationship management. Moreover, the role also emphasises creating and executing localised fiat strategies to aid in the adoption of the crypto-based ecosystem and co-develop existing payment products and markets.,The “Business Development Director, Ecosystem” role in Circle Internet Financial will establish and grow strategic partnerships with major global organisations such as crypto exchanges to drive the adoption and growth of the USD Coin (USDC). The role also looks at the professional and technical knowledge of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.,OKEX “Product Director/Principal Product Manager, On-chain Compliance” role looks at crafting anti-money laundering (AML) compliance software and investigative services for the key participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, advancing compliance platform, and contributing to setting industry standards for cryptocurrency intelligence.,Sriprada added: “The demand for crypto has seen cycles of rise and fall over the last few years, and it is advisable to stay updated with industry news, job platforms specialised in the crypto industry to get the most accurate and up-to-date information on crypto job opportunities.”,\"Crypto hiring thrives in Q1 2024, but April slump highlights volatility and regulatory concerns, says GlobalData\" was originally created and published by Electronic Payments International, a GlobalData owned brand.,, ,The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.
