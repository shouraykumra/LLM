Use Case 1: Utilizing the Mistral Model without Unslothing and Unsmashed Versions (Original 7B Parameters Model)
* CPU Usage: 13GB
* Data Performance: Unable to load on the free version of Google Colab; had to interrupt the kernel as it took a significant amount of time.

â €Use Case 2: Utilizing the Mistral Model without Unslothing and Smashed Versions
* CPU Usage: 5290MB/s
* Data Performance:
  * Task: Running the base model with prompt engineering to generate replies for YouTube comments.
  * CPU Time: 4.57 seconds to generate a reply to a prompt. Significant improvement observed with the introduction of the smashed version of the model.
  * To assess the model's performance, it needs to be trained for a specific use case. For this base case, it performs as expected.

Use Case 3: Utilizing Mistral Model with Lightening Module
Use Case 4: Utilizing Mistral Model with Unsloth
