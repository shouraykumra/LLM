            "['A recent exchange on X between entrepreneur Mark Cuban and a crypto enthusiast has shed light on Vice President Kamala Harris’s evolving stance on cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), in light of the November election.,What Happened: Cuban, responding to a suggestion that Harris should transfer the U.S. government’s 200,000 bitcoin to the treasury, provided insights into his discussions with Harris’s team about crypto policy.,Don’t Miss:,A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.,Groundbreaking trading app with a ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later\\' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market – here’s how to get equity in it with just $100,He pointed out that the treasury is legally obligated to dispose of confiscated assets, including the 69,000 Bitcoin currently in its possession, in a manner that benefits taxpayers.,“I was pushing for all confiscations in crypto to be held and not sold,” Cuban revealed, adding that he advised the team about the potential market impact of selling large amounts of Bitcoin quickly. He noted that the treasury “can’t sell in a way that will move the market” due to legal constraints.,Trending: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing – investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!,Cuban highlighted Harris’s recent statements about protecting digital asset holders, suggesting a significant shift in her understanding of the crypto ecosystem. “If you saw what she said today about protecting people who hold digital assets, it’s really clear they now get it. And it’s not just about btc and favoring the maxis,” he wrote.,Importantly, Cuban emphasized Harris’s recognition of the “app economy” and its relevance to younger generations. “She understands completely, and it really resonates with her that there are a lot of people who are in the ‘app economy’. They don’t open bank accounts. They use apps like Robinhood and Coinbase etc, and it’s easier to understand how to buy crypto,” Cuban explained.,He further noted that Harris is aware that many Gen Z individuals, particularly men, have a significant portion of their net worth in crypto. According to Cuban, Harris has pledged to “do what she can to protect them as consumers and as owners.”,Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?,Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus popularly known as\\xa0Shibetoshi Nakamoto\\xa0also\\xa0responded\\xa0to his tag on the Cuban post. He believes that cryptocurrency is beyond the understanding of many lawmakers and it \"messes with the existing laws.\",Why It Matters: Cuban’s defense of Harris’s cryptocurrency knowledge comes amid her unveiling of a new regulatory framework aimed at supporting digital assets. As part of her “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,” Harris’s proposal acknowledges the growing importance of cryptocurrencies among Black Americans, with over 20% reportedly owning or having owned crypto assets, according to her team.,In another statement, Cuban defended Harris and emphasized her genuine approach compared to other political figures. He noted, “She doesn’t know everything. Unlike your guy [Trump], she doesn’t pretend.

The alleged scheme at one point involved Council impersonating an FBI employee who lost his phone, the government says.,The SEC’s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked in early January, just a day before it was set to announce approval of the first-ever spot market Bitcoin exchange traded products. The hacker took control of the agency’s official account and posted a message that said the SEC had granted approval to a handful of companies’ applications to trade the products.,The approval of the ETFs, which followed a long legal fight between the SEC and the issuer of one of the funds, was one of the most eagerly anticipated events ever in the digital-asset industry.

The funds have seen more than $20 billion of inflows and collectively now hold about $64.5 billion worth of assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.,The fake post with the premature approval caused the price of Bitcoin to surge $1,000, the Justice Department said.

Council allegedly used an identity card printer to create a fake ID for the victim, according to the indictment.,With the fake ID in hand, Council allegedly traveled to an AT&T store in Huntsville, Alabama, to get a SIM card linked to the victim’s account. Council then walked to an Apple store to buy a new iPhone for the swap, according to the indictment.,As soon as access to the victim’s phone was granted, the co-conspirators generated access codes to the victim’s social media accounts and shared them with additional co-conspirators, according to the indictment.,The fake post was issued by one of the unnamed co-conspirators, according to the indictment.

Council was able to take over the person\\'s cellphone number and get access codes to the SEC\\'s X account, which he shared with others who broke into the account and sent the post, the Justice Department says.,Prosecutors say after Council returned the iPhone he used for the SIM swap, his online searches included: “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them.”,An email seeking comment was sent Thursday to an attorney for Council, who is charged in Washington\\'s federal court with conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud.,The price of bitcoin swung from about $46,730 to just below $48,000 after the unauthorized post hit on Jan. 9 and then dropped to around $45,200 after the SEC’s denial. The SEC officially approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin the following day.,Sign in to access your portfolio', 'A 25-year-old Alabama resident named Eric Council Jr. was arrested Thursday morning in connection with the unauthorized takeover of the Security and Exchange Commission’s X account in January, which caused the value of Bitcoin to spike $1,000, according to the Justice Department.,The hack took place on January 9, a day before the SEC’s long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. According to a complaint filed in federal court in Washington, DC, the hackers used the compromised account to falsely post that the approval had taken place. Shortly after, SEC Chair Gary Gensler took to his personal account to announce that the claim was false and the post was “unauthorized.”,“The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products,” Gensler wrote on X.,The phony post was deleted 25 minutes after it went up, but that was enough to move the market. Immediately, investors rushed to purchase Bitcoin, causing the price to spike by $1,000. Once the correction was made, the price fell by $2,000, according to the indictment.,Council, also known online as “Ronin”, “AGiantSchnauzer”, and @Easymunny, is charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud, announced today by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves and others involved in the investigation. The indictment alleges that Council committed these crimes in order to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.,Council and others, who remain unnamed, allegedly accessed the account through what is known as a “SIM swap,” according to the indictment.,“A SIM swap attack refers to the process of fraudulently inducing a carrier to reassign a cell phone number from the legitimate subscriber or user’s SIM card to a SIM card, and telephone, controlled by a criminal actor,” the indictment said, explaining that the trick lets criminals bypass multi-factor authentication.,Council and his co-conspirators allegedly impersonated someone who had access to the account by creating a fraudulent identification document in the victim’s name and took over their cell phone number. The @SECGov X account was linked to this phone number, allowing the hackers to access it and make posts.,Council received payment in Bitcoin for carrying out the SIM swap. During the ensuing investigation, federal agents discovered he reportedly used his personal computer to search for “SECGOV hack,” “federal identity theft statute,” and “how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI.”,“In this case, the unauthorized actor allegedly utilized SIM swapping to manipulate the global financial market,” FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Geist said in a statement. “The FBI will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners around the country and globe to hold accountable those who break U.S. laws.”,If convicted, Council faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison.,This story was originally featured on Fortune.com,Sign in to access your portfolio', 'It’s hard for projects to beat the returns offered by staked ether on a risk-adjusted basis.,Consequently, the asset and its yield are becoming a benchmark for the crypto economy in similar fashion to the fed funds rate and the traditional economy.,Slowly but surely, staked ether (stETH) is becoming a benchmark for the entire on-chain economy.,According to a new report from investment management firm ARK Invest, Ethereum’s monetary policy has turned staked ether into a unique type of asset – one that resembles sovereign bonds.,“The ETH staking yield is a gauge for smart contract activity and economic cycles in the digital asset space, much like the fed funds rate in traditional finance,” wrote Lorenzo Valente, a research associate at ARK Invest.,Ethereum is designed in such a way that ether {{ETH}} holders can stake their tokens, essentially locking them up in the network in exchange for a yield. At the time of writing, the yield on staked ether generating a 3.27% annualized yield, according to CoinDesk CESR data.,There\\'s also a so-called liquid staking token, stETH, from the Lido project, that Ethereum stakers can redeploy into DeFi protocols.,The fact that staked ether produces a yield makes the asset comparable to sovereign bonds, which are debt securities issued by governments to finance themselves. Investors can buy up this debt and earn interest on it over time.,But staked ether differs from bonds in several crucial aspects, the report said.,Some of the distinctions are positive. For example, while governments can default on their debt obligations – like Argentina did in 2020 – Ethereum cannot default on staked ether. The network is programmed to let users access their funds whenever they want, and the yield is designed to keep being issued no matter what happens, though the interest rate will vary depending on on-chain activity. Another big risk for bonds is inflation. If the government prints too much money, and the inflation rate outstrips the yield on bonds, investors end up losing purchasing power.,Ether can also suffer from inflation (as is currently the case) if network activity slows down so much that ether issuance ends up exceeding the ether burn rate – a mechanism that removes a fraction of ether from circulation every time a transaction is made. However, on-chain data makes ether’s inflation rate much more transparent. Data aggregator ultrasound.money shows, for example, that in the last 30 days, ether’s supply expanded at a rate of 0.33% per year.,But exposure to staked ether also comes with its own risks. Staked ether can be destroyed by the network, for example, if the used validators – entities with whom investors stake their ether; their role is to process transactions – suffer from an operational malfunction, or behave in a way that’s detrimental to the network. This is known as \"slashing.\",While government bonds come with political and regulatory risks, they aren’t going to be obliterated by an automatized system if anything goes awry.,Finally, a major appeal of sovereign bonds is their lack of volatility. If the country issuing them is stable, they are usually deemed low-risk investments, and are even sometimes considered cash-like instruments. Ether itself is highly volatile: at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was up 65% in the last 12 months. Naturally, that means staked ether cannot be classified by investors in the same low-risk category as bonds.,“While both can be influenced by inflation, interest rate changes and currency depreciation, the nature of those risks and their implications can vary significantly,” the report said. “Additionally, ETH staking introduces unique risks related to network security, validator behavior, and smart contract bugs, which have no direct parallel in traditional sovereign bonds.”,Generally speaking, there are two different ways investors can stake their ether: by setting up their own validators, or by staking through specialized DeFi protocols like Lido {{LDO}} or Rocket Pool {{RPL}}. These protocols partner up with trusted validators and execute all the technical aspects of staking for their customers.,Importantly, they also provide liquid staking tokens (LSTs), which represent the amount of ether that has been staked by the investor into the network. That’s a massive benefit, because while their ether is locked away earning yield, investors can keep using stETH tokens (the most popular LST) for additional purposes – for example, as collateral in lending protocols.,That advantage is so great that stETH is beginning to replace ETH as the collateral of choice in the DeFi economy.,“Today, stETH supplied as collateral in DeFi totals ~2.7 million, or roughly 31% of the entire stETH supply,” the report said, noting that investors prefer it to other crypto assets due to the “capital efficiency it offers users, liquidity providers and market makers.”,“Currently the collateral of choice on Aave V3, Spark, and MakerDao, 1.3 million stETH, 598,000 stETH, and 420,000 stETH, respectively, are locked into those protocols and used as collateral to issue loans or crypto-backed stablecoins,” it added.,With stETH so widely used across the biggest DeFi protocols, staked ether is slowly forcing the rest of the crypto financial ecosystem to reorganize itself, the report argued.,That’s because projects need to convince investors that, on a risk-adjusted basis, their own assets will offer higher returns than simply staking ether, and compounding those returns, will provide.,“If the ETH yield is 4% after compounding over seven years, [a] closed-end fund would have to outperform ETH more than 31% [over that period of time], even without taking into account price appreciation,” the report said.,It’s one of the reasons why competing Layer 1 projects – like Solana {{SOL}} or Avalanche {{AVAX}} – all offer higher interest rates for investors to stake their tokens. The implication is that these assets are riskier and more volatile, and investors need to be incentivized with higher yields to hold them in the long run.,The demand for staked ether has also put pressure on DeFi protocols in the business of lending stablecoins, according to ARK Invest.,For example, Sky {{SKY}} (formerly MakerDAO) was forced to increase the interest rate on locked DAI (the protocol’s native stablecoin) following significant selling pressure and a decrease in its circulating supply, the report said. Furthermore, on Aave {{AAVE}} and Compound {{COMP}} investors are seeing increased rewards for lending stablecoins – because users would rather lend stETH and borrow stablecoins, than lend stablecoins directly.,In other words, the more stETH captures market share, the more the crypto economy will begin making choices based on staked ether’s yield. And that means staked ether could play the same role in crypto as the Federal Reserve’s funding rate does in the global financial system.,Sign in to access your portfolio', 'There are certain financial events in history that have rippled through to today\\'s economic paradigm.,Perhaps at the top of that list is the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944 — when nations around the world established a system for a fixed currency exchange rate using gold as the universal standard. Eventually, that agreement would be ditched by President Nixon in 1971 when the U.S. moved off the gold standard.,Now, new builders are attempting to enact new economic paradigms using Bitcoin at the center of things. Roundtable anchor Rob Nelson recently sat down with Sasha Mitchell, Head of Operations at BeL2, to discuss an ecosystem project whose founder was one of more than 2,000 students that signed up to be members of the Harvard Innovation Labs this fall.,The New Bretton Woods Project is attempting a develop a new take on the global financial system by leveraging bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) to tackle the mounting global debt crisis.,As Sasha Mitchell explained, ditching the gold standard has introduced a new debt crisis that\\'s been building since President Richard Nixon\\'s decision in 1971. \"It took 200 years to actually reach $1 trillion in debt,\" he noted. \"Now, every three months, the U.S. is growing by $1 trillion of debt—globally, it\\'s $307 trillion.\" Mitchell emphasized the need to \"anchor ourselves back into reality\" by backing currencies with tangible assets.,BeL2\\'s protocol facilitates communication between bitcoin and other blockchains, enabling sophisticated decentralized finance through smart contracts. Mitchell stated, \"We can enable more sophisticated, decentralized finance\" by allowing users to collateralize their bitcoin without moving it off the bitcoin network. This approach could unlock liquidity by minting stablecoins backed by bitcoin\\'s value, offering holders new ways to leverage their assets without selling them.,Rob Nelson highlighted the significance of creating a decentralized stablecoin, noting that it removes reliance on a single centralized currency. \"That\\'s a really significant switch,\" he said.

It read: “Today the SEC grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges.”,The price of Bitcoin spiked more than $1,000 apiece following the post, according to the indictment. After the SEC regained control of its account and issued a statement clarifying that the post was a result of a breach, the price of Bitcoin plummeted by more than $2,000.,At the time, cryptocurrency investors had been closely watching for the regulator’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs, which would allow Bitcoin-related assets to be traded as exchange-traded funds. The SEC issued its official approval of the Bitcoin products the following day.,According to the charges, the SEC and X confirmed that the hack was carried out using a method known as “SIM swapping.” That’s when a fraudster impersonates someone else to a cellular carrier and obtains their SIM details, including their phone number.,Council received other personal identifying information to make a fake ID, which he used to obtain a SIM card linked to the victim’s phone line, the indictment alleges. He then bought a new iPhone with cash and obtained access codes to the @SECGov X account, which he allegedly shared with co-conspirators to gain access to the account.,After issuing the fake post, Council allegedly received payment in Bitcoin before returning the iPhone. He later conducted internet searches for “SECGOV hack,” “telegram sim swap,” “how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI,” and “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them,” the agency said.,“These SIM swapping schemes, where fraudsters trick service providers into giving them control of unsuspecting victims’ phones, can result in devastating financial losses to victims and leaks of sensitive personal and private information,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves. “Here, the conspirators allegedly used their illegal access to a phone to manipulate financial markets.”,Council will make his first court appearance on Thursday in the Northern District of Alabama.,For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.,A 25-year-old Alabama man has been arrested by the FBI for his alleged role in hacking the SEC’s X account earlier this year.,Federal authorities announced Thursday the arrest of a man in Alabama, accusing him of participating in the hack of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\'s X account earlier this year.

As an enticement, those who sign up in certain countries receive a cryptocurrency token called WLD.,The company behind World Network is San Francisco and Erlangen, Germany-based Tools for Humanity. Since the project launched in July 2023, over 6.9 million people have signed up to have their irises scanned, according to the company.,Privacy campaigners have criticized the project over the collection, storage and use of personal data.,Earlier this year, Spain and Portugal issued temporary bans, and Argentina and Britain said they would examine World Network.,(Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco; Editing by Sonali Paul),Sign in to access your portfolio\",\n          \"It\\u2019s hard for projects to beat the returns offered by staked ether on a risk-adjusted basis.,Consequently, the asset and its yield are becoming a benchmark for the crypto economy in similar fashion to the fed funds rate and the traditional economy.,Slowly but surely, staked ether (stETH) is becoming a benchmark for the entire on-chain economy.,According to a new report from investment management firm ARK Invest, Ethereum\\u2019s monetary policy has turned staked ether into a unique type of asset \\u2013 one that resembles sovereign bonds.,\\u201cThe ETH staking yield is a gauge for smart contract activity and economic cycles in the digital asset space, much like the fed funds rate in traditional finance,\\u201d wrote Lorenzo Valente, a research associate at ARK Invest.,Ethereum is designed in such a way that ether {{ETH}} holders can stake their tokens, essentially locking them up in the network in exchange for a yield. At the time of writing, the yield on staked ether generating a 3.27% annualized yield, according to CoinDesk CESR data.,There's also a so-called liquid staking token, stETH, from the Lido project, that Ethereum stakers can redeploy into DeFi protocols.,The fact that staked ether produces a yield makes the asset comparable to sovereign bonds, which are debt securities issued by governments to finance themselves. Investors can buy up this debt and earn interest on it over time.,But staked ether differs from bonds in several crucial aspects, the report said.,Some of the distinctions are positive. For example, while governments can default on their debt obligations \\u2013 like Argentina did in 2020 \\u2013 Ethereum cannot default on staked ether. The network is programmed to let users access their funds whenever they want, and the yield is designed to keep being issued no matter what happens, though the interest rate will vary depending on on-chain activity. Another big risk for bonds is inflation. If the government prints too much money, and the inflation rate outstrips the yield on bonds, investors end up losing purchasing power.,Ether can also suffer from inflation (as is currently the case) if network activity slows down so much that ether issuance ends up exceeding the ether burn rate \\u2013 a mechanism that removes a fraction of ether from circulation every time a transaction is made. However, on-chain data makes ether\\u2019s inflation rate much more transparent. Data aggregator ultrasound.money shows, for example, that in the last 30 days, ether\\u2019s supply expanded at a rate of 0.33% per year.,But exposure to staked ether also comes with its own risks. Staked ether can be destroyed by the network, for example, if the used validators \\u2013 entities with whom investors stake their ether; their role is to process transactions \\u2013 suffer from an operational malfunction, or behave in a way that\\u2019s detrimental to the network. This is known as \\\"slashing.\\\",While government bonds come with political and regulatory risks, they aren\\u2019t going to be obliterated by an automatized system if anything goes awry.,Finally, a major appeal of sovereign bonds is their lack of volatility. If the country issuing them is stable, they are usually deemed low-risk investments, and are even sometimes considered cash-like instruments. Ether itself is highly volatile: at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was up 65% in the last 12 months. Naturally, that means staked ether cannot be classified by investors in the same low-risk category as bonds.,\\u201cWhile both can be influenced by inflation, interest rate changes and currency depreciation, the nature of those risks and their implications can vary significantly,\\u201d the report said. \\u201cAdditionally, ETH staking introduces unique risks related to network security, validator behavior, and smart contract bugs, which have no direct parallel in traditional sovereign bonds.\\u201d,Generally speaking, there are two different ways investors can stake their ether: by setting up their own validators, or by staking through specialized DeFi protocols like Lido {{LDO}} or Rocket Pool {{RPL}}. These protocols partner up with trusted validators and execute all the technical aspects of staking for their customers.,Importantly, they also provide liquid staking tokens (LSTs), which represent the amount of ether that has been staked by the investor into the network. That\\u2019s a massive benefit, because while their ether is locked away earning yield, investors can keep using stETH tokens (the most popular LST) for additional purposes \\u2013 for example, as collateral in lending protocols.,That advantage is so great that stETH is beginning to replace ETH as the collateral of choice in the DeFi economy.,\\u201cToday, stETH supplied as collateral in DeFi totals ~2.7 million, or roughly 31% of the entire stETH supply,\\u201d the report said, noting that investors prefer it to other crypto assets due to the \\u201ccapital efficiency it offers users, liquidity providers and market makers.\\u201d,\\u201cCurrently the collateral of choice on Aave V3, Spark, and MakerDao, 1.3 million stETH, 598,000 stETH, and 420,000 stETH, respectively, are locked into those protocols and used as collateral to issue loans or crypto-backed stablecoins,\\u201d it added.,With stETH so widely used across the biggest DeFi protocols, staked ether is slowly forcing the rest of the crypto financial ecosystem to reorganize itself, the report argued.,That\\u2019s because projects need to convince investors that, on a risk-adjusted basis, their own assets will offer higher returns than simply staking ether, and compounding those returns, will provide.,\\u201cIf the ETH yield is 4% after compounding over seven years, [a] closed-end fund would have to outperform ETH more than 31% [over that period of time], even without taking into account price appreciation,\\u201d the report said.,It\\u2019s one of the reasons why competing Layer 1 projects \\u2013 like Solana {{SOL}} or Avalanche {{AVAX}} \\u2013 all offer higher interest rates for investors to stake their tokens. The implication is that these assets are riskier and more volatile, and investors need to be incentivized with higher yields to hold them in the long run.,The demand for staked ether has also put pressure on DeFi protocols in the business of lending stablecoins, according to ARK Invest.,For example, Sky {{SKY}} (formerly MakerDAO) was forced to increase the interest rate on locked DAI (the protocol\\u2019s native stablecoin) following significant selling pressure and a decrease in its circulating supply, the report said. Furthermore, on Aave {{AAVE}} and Compound {{COMP}} investors are seeing increased rewards for lending stablecoins \\u2013 because users would rather lend stETH and borrow stablecoins, than lend stablecoins directly.,In other words, the more stETH captures market share, the more the crypto economy will begin making choices based on staked ether\\u2019s yield. And that means staked ether could play the same role in crypto as the Federal Reserve\\u2019s funding rate does in the global financial system.,Sign in to access your portfolio\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
